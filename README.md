# FitnessApp
This app was created by Avi, Ayush, Casey, and Ethan.
To run the program, you have to XCode version 14. We recommend using iPhone 13 Pro simulator.
Pull all the files from the respoitory.
To run the simualtor you need to go to XCode on the top left, then developer tools, and lastly simulator.
We had couple problems occur while working on the project because we could only work on one computer due to only having one Mac that would run the correct version of XCode.
